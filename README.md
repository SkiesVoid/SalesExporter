The Sales Reporting App is a streamlined tool designed to assist users in generating sales reports based on different time intervals such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually. Upon launching the app, users are prompted to select the desired report type from a dropdown menu. 
Depending on the chosen report type, the user is then prompted to input sales data either for individual days of the week, a specific week, each month of the year, each quarter, or for the entire year. Once the sales data is entered, the user can generate a report which is then saved as
an Excel file for further analysis or sharing. This application offers a user-friendly interface through the Streamlit library, making it accessible for users to input sales data quickly and efficiently. By automating the process of generating sales reports, the app reduces manual effort
and potential errors, providing users with accurate insights into their sales performance over various timeframes. Whether used by small businesses tracking daily sales or larger enterprises analyzing quarterly trends, the Sales Reporting App serves as a valuable tool for managing and
visualizing sales data effectively.
